# EffNeurep


## Step 1:

Image into 4 block, and 4 smaller networks
Figuring out if there are any improvement
Image into 16 block, and 16 smaller networks
Figuring out if there are any improvement

### Result:
      What are the pros and cons of the Grid?
      
## Step 2: Improve the shortcomming


# Ideas:
## Resrnet
## Diferent Architecture for small parts of an image:
## Last layer as DCT 

## Initial Frequency

## Frequency split, parallel networks
I(x,y) = N_lf(x,y) + N_hf(x,y)

## Resedual learning
Train grid networks on the block
Train a samll network on the resedual 


## Wavelet,
