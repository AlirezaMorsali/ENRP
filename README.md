## Step 1:

* Image into 4 block, and 4 smaller networks
.. Figuring out if there are any improvement
* Image into 16 block, and 16 smaller networks
.. Figuring out if there are any improvement
* Examining the frequency to see at which point we are having loss when scaling down the network


* How does the original network perform on the blocks of image


### Result:
      What are the pros and cons of the Grid?
      
## Step 2: Improve the shortcomming


# Ideas:




## Diferent Architecture for small parts of an image:
## Initialilzaion
Smaller blocks may be sensitive to initialization
## Resrnet


## Frequency split, parallel networks
I(x,y) = N_lf(x,y) + N_hf(x,y)

## Resedual learning
Train grid networks on the block
Train a samll network on the resedual 

## Last layer as DCT 
Check to see if it has been done in other works
we can do both the discrete or training the continous coeeficients

## Wavelet
